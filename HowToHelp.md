# How to help

Hey there. So you wanna help out with this thing? Cool. You don't need to be able to code to help out, just have a willingness to contribute.

## Stuff you can do:

### Non-coding
* Ideas. I need ideas on what to add so let me know if you think of anything that would be a decent addition to the platform.

* Error codes. If you have a look [here](https://github.com/ReCore-sys/ASMShare/blob/main/app.py#L96) you will see a list of messages. These come up when you get an error 404 (this page/thing does not exist). See if you can come up with any more.

* Color schemes. I am not great at graphic design and it took a lot of effort to make this site look good. If you can come up with any other color schemes (changing the teal to another color, different background, ect), let me know, preferably with some images of the colors you want. If I get enough requests, I'll add a theme switcher.

* Database janitor. Yeah it sounds sucky and it probably is. Someone is going to submit some dodgy info and there is not much I can do about it. No amount of regex or profanity filters can outmatch a 17 year intent on naming their assignment a racial slur. The job here mostly entails going through the database an removing/renaming anything like this. The only upside I can offer is getting to see assignment details (no not the files) before anyone else.

* Stress testing. Submit raw binary data, a 52TB image of Shrek, run it on windows 98, just do anything you want to get a nice big error 500 page. If you find a bug before someone else, I'll buy you a lollipop. I'm not joking. Let me know about a bug you found and how to reproduce it, and you can choose a chupachup flavor. (Yeah conditions apply).

* Come up with ideas for Easter eggs. I wanna stick Easter eggs in this thing, so let me know if you can think of any ideas.

* Have problems so I can stick stuff in the FAQ. Ok I'm joking about having problems, but if have any ideas for what sorta thing I can put in the FAQ, give me a shout or flick me a message on Discord, Insta or just a text (linked in readme).

### Coding
* Have a look through the checklist.md to see what I plan on doing.

* Optimize the website. It's kinda chonky. You can either drop some useless stuff from the actual pages so they load faster for people with slow wifi, or clean up some of the python code so it can perform logical operations faster. Better yet, do both.

* Make the site look nicer. You could add some cool CSS animations, resize some elements or just redesign a page.

* Find some funky Python/JS libraries that could do some useful things for the site.

* <strong>HARD WORK</strong> Turn the site into a desktop app. I can provide API's n stuff to get the actual data, but you will need to create a UI to show these. React would probably be easiest since it can support most of the existing CSS and scripts.

* Make the site Discord embeddable.

* Not so much coding as just techy stuff, but see if we can get an externally hosted storage server to hold all the files.
